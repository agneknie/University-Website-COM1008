		<p class="p-accessibility"> This website aims to achieve and maintain WCAG 2.1 AA standards
		in accordance with the UK law and legislation. </p>
		<p class="p-accessibility"> I want as many people as possible to be able to use this website.
		In the pages of this website I attempted to follow W3C (Worldwide Web
		Consortium) guidelines. For example, on these web pages you should be able to:</p>
		<p class="p-accessibility"> Use screen readers without any major problems - alt properties for images
			are included where needed and formed in such a way that they should not 
			disadvantage disabled users;</p>
		<p class="p-accessibility"> Distinguish between elements easily - all elements on the page are placed with
			care and in such a way that any movement issues should not impact the navigation
			of the website;</p>
		<p class="p-accessibility"> Apply your own styles if needed - separate style sheets are used for visual
			layout. </p>
