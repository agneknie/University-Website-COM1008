				<p class="p-blog-story"> Mondays truly are the worst day of the week.
				This morning I spilled my coffee on my laptop keyboard and of course
				the poor thing could not take any more punishment – it stopped working
				entirely. As I made my way to The Diamond through the rain and hills
				of Sheffield I got completely soaking wet and I am sure that it did not
				help my already broken laptop. </p>
				<p class="p-blog-story"> Fortunately, the people at the CiCS help desk
				on the 4th Floor of The Diamond were not affected by the Monday blues
				and were really helpful – they took my laptop and promised to repair
				it in the next few days. Staying without my computer even for 10 minutes
				gives me chills through my spine, so I was obviously terrified none the
				less. Thank god I remembered about the 4th Floor Laptop Loan service –
				I was sitting in the Flexi Space in no time, scrolling through Stack
				Overflow, hoping to find a solution why my images on my webpage are not
				aligning as I want them to. </p>
				<p class="p-blog-story"> Maybe Mondays are not such a bad day when they
				are spent on the 4th Floor of The Diamond. </p>
