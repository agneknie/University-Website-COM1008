				<p class="p-blog-story"> Friday is truly an amazing day – not only it
				is the end of the week, but it is also the day I have the fewest
				lectures! I usually spend this time dedicated to my hobbies (this is a
				word I use for procrastination which keeps me from studying). </p>
				<p class="p-blog-story"> So today I decided to finally edit my videos
				from my most recent trip. I decided to make a documentary vibe short
				video of our vacation from last year but I was disappointed to realise
				that I do not have a proper quality microphone to record my voiceover.
				I was about to study when I suddenly remembered that we have Media
				Booths on the 4th Floor of The Diamond! </p>
				<p class="p-blog-story"> Now I can proudly say – I have made the best
				documentary about Amsterdam from my barely usable footage from my trip.
				The only question left is – When is my Oscar nomination coming?  </p>
