				<p class="p-blog-story"> Yesterday we had our 3rd (and last!) client
				meeting for gathering requirements for the software we are going to
				build in spring. Our clients are last year students, so they should
				understand how hard it is to actually implement stuff but they truly
				played into the character of “THE client” and asked for new and insane
				features in the very last meeting – because why not really. </p>
				<p class="p-blog-story"> Our group decided to meet up today to discuss
				how can we climb out of this requirements hole and if it is at all
				possible. Of course, we are meeting in a Group Study Room on the 4th
				Floor of The Diamond – we like to pretend that we are true engineers!
				Getting the booking was not easy – I heard that one of my team mates
				had to go on some sort of a “Study Room Black Market” to get a room
				there for the next day, but I did not ask any questions – I was just
				happy to get a chance to visit one. </p>
				<p class="p-blog-story"> The discussion itself was quite nice though –
				not because we decided on something in terms of our assignment but
				because we managed to come up with some sick Sheffessions. And I do not
				want to brag but one of them even got published! Definitely giving my
				team mates the maximum score on WebPA.</p>
