				<p class="p-blog-story"> As you may know Wednesday is known as a Sports
				Day – the majority of the games take place on Wednesday afternoons.
				Our team won! Not sure which team exactly because as a true Computer
				Scientist I am not interested in sports at all but my super athletic
				flatmates made sure that I know by partying all night. </p>
				<p class="p-blog-story"> Of course next morning I felt terrible and
				still heard some deep beats coming from the kitchen, so I decided to
				abandon my room and headed straight to the Big Silent Study on the
				4th Floor of The Diamond. The fact that I made a choice of not only
				studying but also leaving my room was a huge achievement, so naturally
				I felt really proud of myself when I found a cosy, silent place in a
				usually crammed Silent Study. Well maybe even too cosy and too silent –
				I woke up on my desk an hour later. </p>
