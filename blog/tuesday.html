				<p class="p-blog-story"> Tuesdays is just an annoying day – I have many
				lectures and labs but most of them have an hour gap in between.
				Usually I spend that time drinking coffee or scrolling through
				Instagram but today I decided to attempt to spend my time productively –
				I am an adult after all! I made a promise to myself, that in each gap I
				will go to a Short-term Silent Study and catch up on lectures or do some
				exercises. Here is exactly how my three gaps in between lectures went: </p>
				<p class="p-blog-story"> 1) Drank coffee, because I could not open my eyes
				after my 9am lecture; </p>
				<p class="p-blog-story"> 2) Read Sheffessions, in hopes to find my own
				submissions. I did not but I found some really good ones and realised
				that I have to step up my game; </p>
				<p class="p-blog-story"> 3) Opened the exercise sheet for COM1002 but at
				the same time I got a notification that I got recognised as one of the
				top fans of Sheffessions, so sent screenshots to all my friends to brag
				about that top fan badge. </p>
				<p class="p-blog-story"> Hopefully my time management skills get better
				with time, because the Short-term Silent Study really looked like a
				wonderful place to catch a short revision session. </p>
